# Sentry Error History

## How to search it

Use the Sentry MCP.

1. **Orient.** If you don't know the project slug and organization:

   ```
   find_organizations
   find_projects
   ```

2. **Search for issues related to the target.**

   ```
   search_issues (natural language, e.g., "errors in PaymentService timeout", "unhandled exceptions in uploadFile")
   ```

   Good query components: exception class names the target handles, the function or class name of the target, error message strings the target checks for, the file path of the target.

3. **Narrow by release and time window.**

   ```
   search_issue_events (filter by release, time, environment, trace ID, tags)
   get_issue_tag_values (for an issue, see distribution across versions, users, environments)
   ```

   For a suspected issue, check:
   - **First seen.** When did the error start appearing?
   - **Last seen.** When did it stop? Does it line up with the target's ship date?
   - **Affected releases.** Which versions saw it? Which was the fix?
   - **Frequency trajectory.** Did it spike, then get resolved?

4. **Pull the full event for context.**

   ```
   get_sentry_resource (pass a Sentry URL or type+ID)
   ```

   Does the stack trace pass through the target code? Do the tags and breadcrumbs match the conditions the target defends against?

5. **Check releases that landed near the target.**

   ```
   find_releases (around the commit date of the target)
   ```

   Cross-reference release version with the PR's merge date.

6. **Use Seer sparingly.**

   ```
   analyze_issue_with_seer
   ```

   Seer produces AI root-cause analyses. Useful as a hypothesis generator, but treat them as inference, not authoritative. The actual events and stack traces are the primary evidence. Seer's narrative is secondary.

## What to return

For each relevant issue:
- Issue ID and title
- Project and organization
- First seen / last seen timestamps
- Event count (and sampling rate if known)
- Affected releases
- A representative stack trace snippet showing relevance to the target (verbatim excerpt, not summary)
- First/last-seen correlation with the target's ship date
- Link to the issue
- Any author comments or resolution notes
